<Second-party-data --> Data collected by a group directrly from its audience and then sold.
<Third-party-data --> Data collected by outside sources who did not collect it directly.

<Note: No matter what kind of data we use, allways need to be inspected for accuracy and avoid bias and errors

<!-- DATA FORMATS -->

- Discrete data -> Data that is counted and has a limited number of values
- Continous data -> Data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value
- Nominal data -> A type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order
- Ordinal data -> A type of qualitative data with a set order or scale
- Internal data -> Data that lives within a company's own systems
- External data -> Data that lives and is generated outside of an organization
- <Structured data -> Data that is organized in a certain format, such as rows and columns
- <Unstructured data -> Data that it no have an order or organization

// DATA MODEL: a model tha is used for organizing data eleements and how they relate to one another

// DATA ELEMENTS: Pieces of information, such as people's names, account numbers and addreses

# DATTA TYPE -> Sepcific kind of data that tells what kind of value the data is

<Data-types on spread sheets: - Number - String - Boolean >

// <WIDE DATA -> Data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject.
// <LONG DATA -> Data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.

<!-- BIAS -->

- Sampling bias: a sample tha is not representative of the population as a whole
- Observer bias: Tendency for different people to observe things differently
- Interpretation bias: Tendency to always interpreter ambiguous situations in a positive or a negative way
- Confirmation bias: Tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs

<!-- 'GOOD' DATA SOURCES -->

- Reliable
- Original
- Comprehensive
- Current
- Cited
  <Note: Every good solution is found by avoiding bad data>

<!-- ASPECTS OF DATA ETHICS -->

- <Ownership: Individuals own the data they provide
- <Transaction transparency: All data-processiong and algorithims shouldbe completely explainable and understood by individuals who provide their data
- <Consent: An individuals right to know explicit details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it
- <Currency: Individuals sould be aware of financial transactions resultin from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions
- <Privacy: Preservig a data subjects informationand activity any time a data transaction occurs
- <Openess: Free access, usage and sharing of data

* DATA INTEROPERABILITY: The ability of data systems and services to openly connect and share data

<!-- DATABASE -->

* //Relational database -> A database that contains a series of related tables that can be connected via their relationships

- Primary key: An identifier that references a column in which each value is unique.
- Foreign key: A field within a table that is a primary key in another table

<Metadata: Data about data>
The metadata tells de analyst what the data it's all about

// 3 Common types of metadata: 
- Descriptive: Metadata thar descibes a piece of data and can be used to identify it at a later point in time

<Data governance -> A process to ensure the formal management of a company's data assets

 * Internal data: Data that lives within a company's own systems
 * External data: Data that lives and is generated outside an organization

 <CSV: a file which stands for Comma-Separated Values, is a plain text file that stores tabular data (numbers and text) in a structured format>

  - > Sorting data: Arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analize and visualize
 - > Filtering: Showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest
